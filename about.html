    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! I'm [Hamza Ali], a passionate and driven Computer Science student at the Karachi Institute of Economics and Technology (KIET). Currently, I am in the last semester of my four-year degree program, specializing in software development, data structures, algorithms, and web technologies.</p>

    <p>Throughout my academic journey, I've gained a deep understanding of various programming languages, frameworks, and tools that are essential for building modern applications. I am particularly interested in full-stack development, and I enjoy working on both the front-end and back-end aspects of web projects.</p>

    <p>My coursework and hands-on projects have allowed me to work with technologies such as <strong>Java, Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, and React.js</strong>. I have developed a strong problem-solving mindset, and I am always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills. I thrive in collaborative environments, and I believe that working with others leads to better solutions.</p>

    <p>During my time at KIET, I've had the opportunity to work on multiple projects, including building web applications, developing mobile apps, and exploring emerging technologies such as machine learning and AI. These experiences have not only honed my technical skills but also taught me valuable lessons in project management, teamwork, and time management.</p>

    <p>In the future, I aim to contribute to the tech industry by working on innovative projects that solve real-world problems. My ultimate goal is to work with a team of like-minded individuals to create impactful software solutions that make a difference in people's lives.</p>

    <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new tech trends, reading tech blogs, or participating in online coding challenges. I believe in continuous learning and staying updated with the ever-evolving tech landscape.</p>

    <p>Feel free to check out my <a href="projects.php" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">projects</a> to see the work I’ve done so far. I’m always open to new opportunities, collaborations, and discussions on exciting projects!</p>
